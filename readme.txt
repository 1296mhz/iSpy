# Compiling iSpy
The 32 bit and 64 bit solutions require **Visual Studio 2015** to build.

For building the Setup project [Wix Toolset 3.10+](http://wixtoolset.org/) must be installed. (Make sure you restart Visual Studio after installing)

Also make sure VS2010 Merge Modules are installed and can be found at:
 * C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Merge Modules\Microsoft_VC100_CRT_x86.msm
 * C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Merge Modules\Microsoft_VC100_CRT_x64.msm

If you can't find the Merge Modules simply copy them from the *Merge Modules* directory in this repository.
